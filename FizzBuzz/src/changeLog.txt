FizzBuzz 3.0:
TODOS:
-modularize driver class.
- add hashtable. 
-add a static method that evaluates the default number of fizz 
buzz games and holds that value in that hashtable with the default number of games
as the key.

CAVEATS:
For any user defined game less than the default number of games,
simply retrieve the existing game and trim the difference off the 
end.
For any game/key greater than the max key of the hash table, lets say n, make that
the new max key by simulating a game from i = current max to i = n and append that to the value of the former
max key.
This new max will offer the same afore-mention logic to any future 
user-defined games.
